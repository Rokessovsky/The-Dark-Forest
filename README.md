# Dark Forest

## A strategy game inspired by Three Body Problem

This is a strategy game based on the **Dark Forest Principle**--the universe is like a dark and cold
forest, all civilizations are like hunters trying to hide themselves and kill any spotted enemy hunters.
Player will be given a new primitive civilization which is unknown to the rest of the universe. Player
will gain certain amounts of development points that can be used to develop technology,society and culture 
each time unit.After a certain time or a certain development level players will encounter other civilizations
either proactively or passively depends on the details of the development of player's civilization. Based on 
the **Dark Forest Principle** the two civilization will only try to destroy each other and only one civilization
will survive. The goal of the player is to survive as long as possible, there'll be no such thing called winning
in this game there will be infinite number of civilizations.

Anyone could play this game, especially those who has read the Liu Cixi's Three Body Problem.I'm very
interested in the book and dark forest principle. That's the main motivation that trigger me to do this project.
